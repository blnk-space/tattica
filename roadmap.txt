_withBlocks became the main part of this library

NOW IT'S NOT WORKING!!!

TODO:
[x] moved to Webpack
[x] add waitIntersections in main
[ ] transfer _withBlocks in main part
[x] divide modules in lib/
[ ] pass navigator.connection.effectivetype to loader
    - ad props in loader => load effectivetype relative to 'connectionValue'
[ ] decide between browsersync and http-server

[ ] arrived at loader in transforming everything to object (easier to mantain)
