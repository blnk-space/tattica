_withBlocks became the main part of this library

NOW IT'S NOT WORKING!!!

TODO:
[x] moved to Webpack
[x] add waitIntersections in main
[x] transfer _withBlocks in main part
[x] divide modules in lib/
[x] pass navigator.connection.effectivetype to loader
    - ad props in loader => load effectivetype relative to 'connectionValue'
[x] decide between browsersync and http-server
[x] arrived at loader in transforming everything to object (easier to mantain)
[x] add timestamp feature
[x] set up mocha and puppeteer testing
